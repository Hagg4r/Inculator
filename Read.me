### Explanation:
1. **SQL Injection Payloads**: A variety of SQL injection payloads are included to test different types of vulnerabilities.
2. **SQLMap Commands**: Multiple SQLMap commands are added to comprehensively scan the target URL for vulnerabilities.
3. **Automated Execution**: The script automatically executes the SQL injection and SQLMap scans, saving results to the specified directory.
4. **Results Saving**: Each scan's results are saved in a sequentially named text file in the provided results directory.
5. **Directory Creation**: The script checks if the results directory exists and creates it if it doesn't.

### Usage:
1. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure the necessary tools (uniscan, nmap, sqlmap, whois, subfinder, seclists) are installed.
2. **Run the Script**: Execute the script, provide the target URL, and specify the results directory when prompted.
3. **View Results**: The results of the scans will be saved in the specified directory for review.
